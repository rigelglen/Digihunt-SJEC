        <h1>Chapter 1: Meet Her Highness, Andromeda.</h1>
        <div id="page">
            <p>In a distant kingdom ruled by benevolent royalty, a free-spirited queen resided in the palace made of
                crystal and gold. Queen Andromeda, for she was named after the stars, was raised as a warrior, but had
                a soul as gentle as that of a fawn. The kingdom was prosperous and had nothing to fear, except a beast
                of a terrible temperament. It was rumoured that this monster could flatten an entire mountain if it was
                enraged. Many brave knights had set out to vanquish it, but none had lived to tell the tale.<br><br>
                Queen Andromeda feared for her people, and she has approached you and your team of mercenaries to find
                and kill this dragon.<br><br></p>
