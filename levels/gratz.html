            <p>The beast lay in wait for the brave souls that ventured forth to defeat it. It breathed fire and the
                cave was sweltering. You charged at it, and the battle seemed to go on for hours. But none that
                preceded you had the favour of the great wizard, and his gifts made you more powerful. The dragon
                fought and it defended and it clawed â€“ but to no avail. As the dragon breathed its last and fell to the
                ground with a dull thud, a deafening silence fell on the land.<br><br>
                At last, the beast was vanquished! And you are the heroes who did it!
